/**
 * @linkedlists are suitable for @stacks due to the fact that they feed us methods @append & @remove_end that 
 * are O(1) in time execution rather than @dynamic_arrays with a O(n) time complexity with the same methods
 * Exception has to be made there for @static_arrays with provide a @push method of O(1) 
 * 
 * @linkedLists are also better than @queue owing to the constant time execution of @remove_top & @append
